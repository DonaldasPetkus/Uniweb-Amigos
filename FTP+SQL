I'm not sure if that's a good idea to write this here, because public can see this, but if we will decide it's not safe, I will change passwords.

Website link will be - www.project4uni.com/uniweb - (with slash+uniweb) currently empty obviously. Or we can buy another domain if you like, which will cost around 10 dollars. For example www.uniweb-amigos.com

Here is the FTP access:

Link - ftp://project4uni.com/ or if you use somethink like FileZilla, use server 79.98.24.7
Username - uniweb1@project4uni.com
Password - UniwebFTP123


Here is SQL Access:

Link - https://karosas.serveriai.lt/MyAdmin/
Database:	vandenis_uniweb
Host:		localhost
Username:	vandenis_uniweb
Password:	UniwebSQL123
